This repository was created to provide supportive data and information to a manuscript submitted to Journal of Fish Biology. The goal was to assess the best strategy for performing rapid assessments of reef fish assemblages. During this procedure, we discussed the trade-off between sampling more or sampling longer videos and provided an advice on minimum sampling effort suitable for reefs in Northeastern Brazil.
